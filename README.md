 In the initial phase of Data Cleaning and Preparations, we perform the following actions;
  1. Data Loading and Inspection : To have a general overview of the data.
  2. Handling missing Variables : Address missing data using appropriate techniques by manual imputation, using the verage of the numerical data and model for the non-numerical data.
  3. Data Cleaning and Formatting : Ensures dsta consistency and formatting by grouping them into the appropriate categories.
 
 ### Data Analysis

  This is where we include some basic lines or queries or even some of the DAX expression used during your analysis;

```SQL
